/*
ðŸ”¹ **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - We iterate through the array **once** (O(n)).
   - Hash map operations (lookup & insert) are **O(1)** on average.
   - Overall, the complexity is **O(n)**.

ðŸ”¹ **Space Complexity:** O(n)
   - We store unique elements in a new slice (`result`), which in the worst case is O(n).
   - The hash map (`seen`) also requires O(n) space for tracking unique elements.

ðŸ”¹ **Is it Iterative?** âœ… YES
   - The function uses **a single loop** (iterative approach) to process the array.
   - Thereâ€™s no recursion involved.

ðŸ”¹ **Why is this optimal?**
   - This approach ensures that **duplicates are removed in a single pass**.
   - It **preserves order**, unlike solutions using sorting.
   - Hash map lookups are **O(1)** on average, making it faster than nested loops.

ðŸš€ **Best for interviews!** Uses hash maps effectively and works efficiently.
